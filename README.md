# Big-Data-Processing--A-detailed-data-analysis-on-New-York-Accident-Data
This paper conducts a detailed data analysis report on New York accident data provided by New York Police Department  (NYPD) and maintained by NYC OpenData. The main aim of the project is to model the data from one of the busiest traffic in the world, to ensure traffic safety and to identify the significant features in the data. Different models like K-Mean Clustering, Neural Network, Decision tree are built to predict or classify different factors and a Principal component analysis is used to reduce the number of variables. The results can be used for future references and to expand any new study on the data.
